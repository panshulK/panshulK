- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @panshulK
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning to become an efficient developer. Would like to stick to coding for a longer period & contribute to coding community with something useful (Still finding out that useful "thingy" !)
- I've been learning Drupal since November 2015 and I believe in learning and sharing. When I'm not coding, I'm busy finding new cafes and reading books. For all my latest blogs please follow https://panshulkhurana.com/codelekhk
- Follow my Youtube Channel for Drupal related Videos - https://bit.ly/3cx19sn
- Know more about me from - http://panshulkhurana.com
- Drupal achievements - https://certification.acquia.com/user/7371
- Outside Drupal/Coding world - Wish to become a motivational speaker and I use Youtube as a medium to walk that lane. To know more about this, head over to the youtube channel - https://bit.ly/2S4qTEv or visit - https://panshulkhurana.com/beingsoulistic (This is still under construction, you can visit us on instagram - @beingsoulistic or Youtube.)
