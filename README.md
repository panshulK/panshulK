ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Panshul Khurana, Staff Software Engineer at Axelerant, dedicated to building innovative applications and driven by a love for reading and continuous learning.

My journey as a web developer began with Drupal 7. Over the years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Additionally, I have a foundational understanding of video editing.
